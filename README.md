The files are named as mentioned. To run the code, the .yml file can be installed and set up for the environment. Novelty assessment folder consists of the tasks which were needed to be performed after the final evaluation. 
The main.ipynb file consists of the interface code. The models trained could not be uploaded due to file size constraints of github, as my model takes size of 2.5 GB. Outputs have also been cleared from code files, due to the file size constraints.
After setting up the environment, the codes can be run straightaway, given the entire zip file has been downloaded from github.
For testing directly in the main.ipynb file, following link of model has been attached. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1efzeGoNwj4wJEc1QoBqylkcL9H3TE8d_/view?usp=sharing
