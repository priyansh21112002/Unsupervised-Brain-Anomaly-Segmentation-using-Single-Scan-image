Latent Space Clustering for Novelty Detection
Concept: Use clustering in VAEâ€™s latent space to identify novel patterns.
Method: Apply K-means clustering to latent space; anomalies deviate from main clusters.
Benefit: More robust detection through feature distribution analysis.

Multiscale Feature Fusion
Concept: Enhance VAE with multi-scale feature extraction.
Method: Integrate convolutional layers with various kernel sizes in VAE encoder.
Benefit: Greater sensitivity to varied anomaly types and sizes.
